# Data Sources (Public & Reproducible)

This framework is designed to be evaluated and discussed using **publicly available datasets**, without relying on proprietary experiments or private biological data.

The purpose of this section is to indicate **possible observational data sources** that can be used to explore cellular aging as a **loss of proportionality** across energetic, informational, and structural domains.

No implementation details, processing pipelines, or predictive models are provided.

## Candidate Public Data Sources

### 1. Epigenetic Aging Data
- Public epigenetic clock datasets (DNA methylation age estimates)
- Longitudinal methylation studies with age annotations

Examples:
- GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)
- ENCODE project

---

### 2. Transcriptomic Noise & Gene Expression Variability
- Bulk RNA-seq datasets across age cohorts
- Studies reporting transcriptional noise increase with age

Examples:
- GEO RNA-seq aging datasets
- GTEx (age-stratified tissue expression)

---

### 3. Mitochondrial & Metabolic Indicators
- Public measurements related to mitochondrial efficiency, ATP production, or metabolic stress markers
- Indirect proxies of energetic imbalance

Examples:
- Metabolomics Workbench
- Aging-related metabolic studies with open data

---

### 4. Structural & Cellular Architecture Proxies
- Cytoskeletal organization markers
- Nuclear morphology or chromatin organization datasets

Examples:
- Image-based public repositories
- Aging cell atlases

---

## Observational Use

These datasets may be used **comparatively and descriptively** to:
- observe divergence between energetic, informational, and structural indicators
- explore coherence loss trends with age
- discuss emergent thresholds without defining fixed decision rules

No claims of prediction or intervention are made.

## Scope Note

This framework remains:
- theoretical and observational
- non-clinical
- non-diagnostic

Any operational, predictive, or intervention-oriented implementation belongs to protected extensions of the Congruity framework and is **explicitly out of scope** here.
