## Abstract

Cellular aging is traditionally described as a multifactorial process driven by
molecular damage accumulation, epigenetic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction,
and loss of homeostasis.

Despite extensive experimental characterization, existing models often fail to
explain the synchronized decline across biological domains, the emergence of
threshold-like transitions into senescence, and the partial reversibility observed
under specific interventions.

Here we introduce a theoretical and observational framework based on the principle
of *Congruity*, interpreting cellular aging as a progressive loss of proportionality
between energy, information, structure, and functional value.

The framework is intentionally implementation-agnostic and relies on reproducible,
publicly available indicators. It provides a system-level lens capable of integrating
existing aging theories while preserving domain independence.

## 1. Introduction

Aging research has produced a rich set of mechanistic insights at molecular,
epigenetic, and metabolic levels. However, these insights often remain fragmented,
describing local processes rather than the global structure of decline.

The Congruity 7.0 framework addresses aging at a structural level, focusing on how
misalignment between biological domains accumulates and eventually leads to
system-wide failure.

---

## 2. Conceptual Framework

In the Congruity perspective, a biological system is considered coherent when the
functional value generated is proportionate to the energetic, informational, and
structural costs required to sustain it over time.

At the cellular level, aging emerges as divergence among:
- Energetic efficiency and metabolic demand
- Informational integrity and signaling fidelity
- Structural adaptability and architectural constraints
- Functional output and adaptive capacity

Loss of proportionality across these domains precedes observable failure.

## 3. Aging as Structural Drift

Within this framework, aging is not interpreted as simple damage accumulation, but
as a gradual distortion of internal scale relationships.

Characteristic manifestations include:
- Energetic overload without functional gain
- Informational noise and epigenetic instability
- Structural rigidity and reduced adaptability
- Declining functional resilience

Once a critical level of incongruity is reached, systems transition into senescence,
inflammation, or dysfunction through threshold-like behavior.

## 4. Relationship to Existing Models

The Congruity framework does not replace established aging theories.
Instead, it provides a unifying interpretive layer capable of explaining why:
- Local interventions often yield transient benefits
- Partial rejuvenation does not restore full systemic function
- Coherence across domains acts as a bottleneck

This interpretation aligns with observations from systems biology and network aging,
while remaining independent of specific computational implementations.

## 5. Observational Implications

The framework supports observational analysis based on publicly available datasets,
including energetic, informational, and structural indicators.

Rather than predicting outcomes, the approach focuses on identifying divergence
patterns, coherence thresholds, and partial realignment signals across biological
scales.

## 6. Scope and Limitations

This work:
- Does not propose clinical therapies
- Does not define biological protocols
- Does not disclose computational pipelines
- Is not intended for medical decision-making

It represents a theoretical structure designed to clarify the architecture of
cellular aging.

## 7. Conclusion

Cellular aging can be coherently described as a problem of proportion and scale,
rather than isolated biochemical failure.

The Congruity 7.0 framework offers a neutral, system-level lens for integrating
existing observations and guiding future empirical investigation.
